# What is this ?

CWissKnife is a multi-purpose mod menu for the game Content Warning, intended to give a better understanding of the game's mechanics (such as for speedrunners) or simply to play around. Don't use in public lobbies and ruin the fun for others (it's disabled anyways).

This mod includes:
* Noclip
* Player speed modifier
* Infinite stamina
* Infinite battery on all tools
* Infinite oxygen
* Infinite camera recordings
* God mode (No damage) -- you can still die from going out of bounds or depleting oxygen

> WARNING: This mod only works on friend only servers, host only. This behavior is **intended**.

# How to install
Use r2modman / thunderstore client to install or simply drag the .dll file in your BepInEx `plugins` folder.

This mod **requires** [BepInExConfigurationManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/Azumatt/Official_BepInExConfigurationManager/) to work. If using r2modman / thunderstore client, it will be installed automatically. If installing manually, you should follow the instructions on the mod's page.

# How to use
Press BepInEx's Configuration Manager hotkey (default `F1`) to open the menu and click on "CWissKnife" to open the options. There, you can toggle the different patches you want. Hover over any option to see a description.

If you find Noclip too slow, also toggle Speed Multiplier and set it to a higher value.

# Additional notes
If you get caught by a creature while in God mode, Noclip / Speed sometimes won't help. I'm currently working on a better Noclip method, which will unstuck the player. In the meantime, you can always disable God mode / Infinite oxygen and wait for your inevitable fate.
