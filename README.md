# What is this ?

CWissKnife is a multi-purpose mod menu for the game Content Warning, intended to give a better understanding of the game's mechanics (such as for speedrunners) or simply to play around. Don't use in public lobbies and ruin the fun for others.

This mod includes:
* Noclip
* Player speed modifier
* Infinite stamina
* Infinite battery on all tools
* Infinite oxygen
* Infinite camera recordings
* God mode (No damage) -- you can still die from going out of bounds or depleting oxygen

> WARNING: This mod should work nomatter if you are the host or not.

# How to install
Use r2modman / thunderstore client to install or simply drag the .dll file in your BepInEx `plugins` folder.

This mod **requires** [BepInExConfigurationManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/Azumatt/Official_BepInExConfigurationManager/) to work. If using r2modman / thunderstore client, it will be installed automatically. If installing manually, you should follow the instructions on the mod's page.

# How to use
Press BepInEx's Configuration Manager hotkey (default `F1`) to open the menu and click on "CWissKnife" to open the options. There, you can toggle the different patches you want. Hover over any option to see a description.

If you find Noclip too slow, also toggle Speed Multiplier and set it to a higher value.

# Additional notes
If you get caught by a creature while in God mode, Noclip / Speed sometimes won't help. I'm currently working on a better Noclip method, which will unstuck the player. In the meantime, you can always disable God mode / Infinite oxygen and wait for your inevitable fate.
